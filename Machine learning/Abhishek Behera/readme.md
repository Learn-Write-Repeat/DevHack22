**Greetings Panel**,
- I have participated in this DevHack22 Hackathon and built a model using different algorithms such as 
Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, KNN Classifier and Random Forest Classifier out of which the Random forest Classifier has proved to be the best with an accuracy score of about 77.5%.
