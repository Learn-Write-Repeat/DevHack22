WHAT I HAD DONE : In this project first I performed a exploratory data analysis on the dataset which includes of data cleaning , data manipulation, data preprocessing , data visualization and after that I did the model building using different machine learning classification and regression algorithms and then predicted the accuracy of every model . In the model prediction part I used different machine learning algorithms . In each algorithm I had included the accuracy score. While in the EDA part I have included different plots for the different visualizations of our dataset . During the model prediction I got different accuracies from different models , I got the highest accuracy of 81 % using the Gradient Boosting Classifierand Extra Trees Classifier which is quite well for the given Glass Prediction dataset . While the other model accuracies can be increased more using the hypertuning . Some plots which I used for visualizing the dataset are Histogram , Barplot , Boxplot, Heatmap , Scatter plot , Pairplot ,Jointplot etc.

MODELS and Accuracy Scores :

Linear Regression : 76.64 %

DECISION TREE CLASSIFIER : 66.15 %

Random Forest Classifier : 76.38 %

GradientBoostingClassifier : 80 %

K Neighbors Classifier : 61%

Cat Boost Classifier : 75.39 %

Extra Trees Classifier : 80 %

LIBRARIES:

PANDAS

NUMPY

MATPLOTLIB

SEABORN

SCIPY

SKLEARN

CONCLUSION :

So we get a accuracy score of about 81 % using Gradient Boosting Classifier and Extra Trees Classifier.

The accuracy of other models can be increased further by Hyper parameter tuning.
