### Problem Statement:
Using Machine Learning Algorithms to classify the type of the glass.

### Dataset:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/glass+identification


### Modules involved:
1. Import libraries required
2. Loading Data from the dataset link and creating the dataframe
3. Data Preprocessing by removing unwanted data and checking for missing values
4. Exploratory Data Analysis
5. Performing Smote Analysis to balance data
6. Splitting the dataset into train and test sets
7. Building and Training multiple ML models
8. Models performance comparision
9. Evaluating model for overfitting using cross validation
10. Checking the accuracy of the Random forest classifier 
### Result:
#### Random Forest Classfier is the best model for the given dataset with an accuracy of 89%.
