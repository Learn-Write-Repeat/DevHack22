## Problem Statement:
Using Machine Learning Algorithms to classify the type of the glass.

## Dataset:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/glass+identification

## Modules involved:
Import libraries required <br>
Loading Data from the dataset link and creating the dataframe <br> 
Data Preprocessing by removing unwanted data and checking for missing values <br>
Splitting the dataset into train and test sets <br>
Building and Training multiple ML models <br>
Models performance comparision <br>

## Result:
 Xgboost performs well on both train and test data with accuracy of **100%** on train dataset and **96.29%** test dataset resepctively.
