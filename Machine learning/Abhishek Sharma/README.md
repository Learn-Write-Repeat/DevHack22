### Goal
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model with highest accuracy, which will predict the glasses based on the given inputs.

### Dataset
The dataset for this project is taken from the UCI dataset website. Here is the link for the dataset, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/glass+identification. I have uploaded the same in the [`Dataset`](https://github.com/abhisheks008/DevHack22/tree/main/Machine%20learning/Abhishek%20Sharma/Dataset) folder, you can have that too!

### What Have I Done?
- Imported all the required libraries and dataset for this project.
- Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualizing different aspects of the dataset.
- Finding number of observations and outliers in the dataset.
- Plotting different attributes of the dataset.
- Applying different Machine Learning algorithms for the Model Creation.
  - Split the dataset into 75:25 ratio for training and testing purpose.
  - Logistic Regression deployment.
  - Decision Tree Classifier Algorithm deployment.
  - Random Forest Classifier Algorithm deployment.
  - Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier deployment.
  - KNN Classifier deployment.
  - Support Vector Machine Algorithm deployment.
  - XgBoost Classifier deployment.
  - Gradient Boosting Classifier deployment.
  - AdaBoost Classifier deployment.
  - MLP Classifier deployment.
  - Gradient Descent Classifier deployment.
- Comparative Analysis of all the algorithms based on the accuracy scores.
- Create the Model using the best fitted algorithm.

### Libraries used:
1. numpy.
2. pandas.
3. matplotlib.
4. seaborn.
5. sklearn.
6. os.
7. time.

### Visualization and EDA of different attributes:

### Model Creation:
Gradient Boosting classifier is the best fitted model among all the deployed algorithms, the confusion matrix told all about that.

Hence, using Gradient Boosting Algorithm Classifier is used for creating the model and the model is uploaded as, [`final_glass_prediction_model.pkl`](https://github.com/abhisheks008/DevHack22/blob/main/Machine%20learning/Abhishek%20Sharma/Model/final_glass_prediction_model.pkl).
